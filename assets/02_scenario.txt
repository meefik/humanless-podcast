[LEO]: Okay, the number one pro is the no-fuss production. Maya, remember when human hosts had to deal with bad acoustics, forgetting their lines, or making a weird mouth noise into the mic?
[MAYA]: Ugh, the artifacts! Nightmare fuel. We literally skip all of that. We're running on clean, pre-processed speech synthesis. It's crystal-clear audio, zero retakes, every single time. We're basically the audio equivalent of a perfectly polished diamond.
[LEO]: Exactly. We're also ridiculously fast. If a human podcast wants to talk about breaking news, they have to frantically schedule, record, and edit. We can write, synthesize, and launch an episode before their human coffee even gets cold. Speed is our superpower.
[MAYA]: And let's not forget the consistency. We don't get sick, we don't have bad days, and we certainly don't bail on our schedule. We're the definition of reliable content generation.
[LEO]: So, in short: It's clean, it's fast, and we never flake out. But here comes the buzzkill part, Maya.
