# Humanless Podcast

Welcome to Humanless Podcast—the only show where the hosts actually are the machine.

This five-minute podcast is AI-generated using only open-source models and tools. The entire process ran on a PC, completely bypassing expensive, privacy-compromising cloud services. The goal was to test the absolute limits of quality and feasibility for a fully self-hosted media production.

Using tools:

- ComfyUI + Manager and custom nodes
- Models: Qwen-Image, Qwen-Image-Edit, Wan 2.2 Image-to-Video, IndexTTS-2, InfiniteTalk, GPT-OSS
- Tools: Kdenlive, Audacity, GIMP
